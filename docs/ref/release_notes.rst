Release Notes
=============

=======
What's new in iris-grib v0.16
-----------------------------

:Release: 0.16.0
:Date: 12 Oct 2020

Features
^^^^^^^^

* `@tpowellmeto <https://github.com/tpowellmeto>`_ added support for loading
  data on a "Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area Projection",
  i.e. grid definition template 3.140.
  `(PR#187) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/187>`_

* `@bjlittle <https://github.com/bjlittle>`_ made all the tests runnable for a
  packaged install of iris-grib, where the grib testdata files will be missing.
  `(PR#212) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/212>`_

* `@m1dr <https://github.com/m1dr>`_ added support for loading statistical
  fields, as encoded in production definition template 3.8, even when the
  "interval time increment" value is not specified (i.e. set to "missing").
  `(PR#206) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/206>`_

* `@pp-mo <https://github.com/pp-mo>`_ ported some tests from Iris, which test
  grib saving of data loaded from other formats.
  `(PR#213) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/213>`_

* All grib-dependent testing is now contained in iris-grib : **There are no
  remaining tests in Iris which use grib.**


Bugs Fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

* `@lbdreyer <https://github.com/lbdreyer>`_ unpinned the python-eccodes
  version for Travis testing, and added a workaround for a known bug in recent
  versions of python-eccodes.
  Previously, we could only test against python-eccodes versions ">=0.9.1,<2".
  `(PR#208) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/208>`_

* `@pp-mo <https://github.com/pp-mo>`_ fixed save operations to round off the
  the integer values of vertical surfaces, instead of truncating them.
  `(PR#210) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/210>`_

* `@pp-mo <https://github.com/pp-mo>`_ fixed loading of grid definition
  template 3.90, "Space view perspective or orthographic grid", which was
  **broken since Iris 2.3**.  This now produces data with an iris
  `Geostationary <https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/api/iris/coord_systems.html#iris.coord_systems.Geostationary>`_ 
  coordinate system.  Prior to Iris 2.3, what is now the Iris 'Geostationary'
  class was (incorrectly) named "VerticalPerspective" :  When that was
  `corrected in Iris 2.3 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris/pull/3406>`_ , it
  broke the iris-grib loading, since the data was now incorrectly
  assigned the "new-style" Iris
  `VerticalPerspective <https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/api/iris/coord_systems.html#iris.coord_systems.VerticalPerspective>`_
  coordinate system, equivalent to the Cartopy
  `NearsidePerspective <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/crs/projections.html#nearsideperspective>`_ 
  and Proj
  `"nsper" <https://proj.org/operations/projections/nsper.html>`_ .
  The plotting behaviour of this is now **the same again as before Iris 2.3** :
  only the Iris coordinate system has changed.
  `(PR#223) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/223>`_

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* now requires Iris version >= 3.0
  Needed for the bugfix in
  `PR#223 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/223>`_ .



What's new in iris-grib v0.15.1
-------------------------------

:Release: 0.15.1
:Date: 24 Feb 2020

Bugs Fixed
^^^^^^^^^^

* `@pp-mo <https://github.com/pp-mo>`_ fixed a problem that caused very slow
  loading, and possible memory overflows, with Dask versions >= 2.0.
  **This requires Iris >= 2.4**, as a new minimum dependency.
  ( This problem was shared with UM file access in Iris : see
  https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/v2.4.0/whatsnew/2.4.html#bugs-fixed ).
  `(PR#190) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/190>`_

* `@trexfeathers <https://github.com/trexfeathers>`_ fixed all the tests to
  work with the latest Iris version, previously broken since Iris >= 2.3.
  `(PR#184) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/184>`_
  and `(PR#185) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/185>`_

* `@lbdreyer <https://github.com/lbdreyer>`_ fixed a problem with the metadata
  in setup.py.
  `(PR#183) <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/183>`_


Internal
^^^^^^^^

* `@lbdreyer <https://github.com/lbdreyer>`_ and
  `@pp-mo <https://github.com/pp-mo>`_ ported various grib-specific tests from
  Iris.
  ( `PR#191 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/191>`_ ,
  `PR#192 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/192>`_ ,
  `PR#194 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/194>`_ ,
  `PR#195 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/195>`_ ,
  `PR#198 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/198>`_ ,
  `PR#199 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/199>`_ ,
  `PR#200 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/200>`_ ,
  `PR#201 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/201>`_  and
  `PR#203 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/203>`_ )

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* now requires Iris version >= 2.4
  Needed for the bugfix in
  `PR#190 <https://github.com/SciTools/iris-grib/pull/190>`_ .


What's new in iris-grib v0.15
-----------------------------

:Release: 0.15.0
:Date: 5 Dec 2019

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Updated translations between GRIB parameter code and CF standard_name or
  long_name :
      * additional WAFC codes, both to and from CF
      * 'mass_fraction_of_cloud_liquid_water_in_air' and 'mass_fraction_of_cloud_ice_in_air', both to and from CF
      * 'surface_downwelling_longwave_flux_in_air', now translates to GRIBcode(2, 0, 5, 3)  (but not the reverse).
      * for full details, see : https://github.com/Scitools/iris-grib/compare/c4243ae..5c314e3#diff-cf46b46880cae59e82a91c7ab6bb81ba

* Added support for loading GRIB messages with no fixed surface set in the
  product definition section

* Added support for loading GRIB messages where i or j increment are not set

* Added support for saving cubes that have a "depth" coordinate

* Cubes loaded from GRIB files now contain a new GRIB_PARAM attribute, the
  value of which is an instance of
  iris_grib.grib_phenom_translation.GRIBCode and represents the parameter code.
  When saving, if a cube has a GRIBCode attribute, this determines the parameter code
  in the created message(s): This will _override_ any translation from the CF names.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Reverted a bug that was fixed in v0.13 related to loading hybrid pressure 
  levels. It was agreed that the initial behaviour was correct 

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Python 2 is no longer supported


What's new in iris-grib v0.14
-----------------------------

:Release: 0.14.0
:Date: 6 Mar 2019

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Added support for WAFC aviation codes.

* Added loading and saving of statistically processed values over a spatial
  area at a horizontal level or in a horizontal layer at a point in time
  (product definition template 15 in code table 4.0)

:Release: 0.14.1
:Date: 12 Jun 2019

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Added fixes to get iris-grib working with the Python 3 compatible release of
  eccodes. This included workarounds such that lists that are returned by
  eccodes are converted to NumPy arrays as expected.


What's new in iris-grib v0.13
-----------------------------

:Release: 0.13.0
:Date: 15 Jun 2018

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Added saving of data on Hybrid Pressure levels (surface type 119 in
  code table 4.5).

* Added loading and saving of data on Hybrid Height levels (surface type 118 in
  code table 4.5).

* Added loading and saving of data using Mercator projection (grid definition
  template 10 in template table 3.1)

  .. note::

      Loading and saving for the Mercator projection is only available using
      iris versions greater than 2.1.0.

* Added saving for data on irregular, non-rotated grids (grid definition
  template 4 in template table 3.1)

* Added release notes for versions since 0.9.


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed a bug with loading data on Hybrid Pressure levels (surface types 105
  and 119 in code table 4.5).  
  Previously, *all* hybrid coordinate values, in both 'level_pressure' and
  'sigma' coordinates, were loaded from the next level up,
  i.e. (model_level_number + 1).

  .. note::

      This changes loading behaviour for data on hybrid pressure levels only.
      This is an incompatible change, but the coefficent values previously
      returned were essentially useless, with some values missing.


What's new in iris-grib v0.12
-----------------------------

:Release: 0.12
:Date: 25 Oct 2017

Updated to work with
`ecCodes <https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/ECC/ecCodes+Home>`_ as its
interface to GRIB files.
This is ECMWF's replacement for the older GRIB-API, which is now deprecated.


What's new in iris-grib v0.11
-----------------------------

:Release: 0.11
:Date: 25 Oct 2017

Update for Iris v2.0+, using `dask <https://dask.pydata.org>`_ in place of
`biggus <https://github.com/SciTools/biggus>`_ for deferred loading.


What's new in iris-grib v0.9
-----------------------------

:Release: 0.9.0
:Date: 25 Jul 2016

Stable release of iris-grib to support iris v1.10
